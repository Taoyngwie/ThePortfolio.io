                <h2>What is this game :</h2>
                <p>This game is a game. 
					Players must ride their bicycles to collect electrical energy and use
					 them as points to conserve natural resources and the planet in accordance with 
					 The trend of sustainability is coming in the concept of preserving the world's nature.</p>
                <h2>Why this game :</h2>
                <p>The origin and importance of this game was developed 
					to be used in competitions for hackathon competition 
					It only lasts for 3 days and developers have to create a
					 project to match the theme to compete in the event. 
					 Our team has created an electric cycling game.</p>
                <h2>HOW :</h2>
                <p>This game will work by having the player
					 play on an electric bicycle in a fitness center
					  or anywhere and there will be sensors to detect 
					  or process images and then display them within the
					   game for use in calculations. How long will the player 
					   travel and how much electricity can be stored? Because the 
					   electric connector is connected to the movement of the player when 
					   cycling to use electricity in emergencies or can be used to reduce future expenses.</p>
